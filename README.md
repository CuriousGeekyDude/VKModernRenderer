# VKModernRenderer
 
# How to build the project

Make sure to have visual studio 2022 with a C++20 compiler and vcpkg installed and configured.

- Install requests using pip: pip install requests

- Run build.py found in root directory.

- Run the already present visual studio .sln and compile. Thats it. You can run the renderer now.
